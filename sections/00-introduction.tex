    \begin{posnexItemize}
        \item[\sA] \sE{Footprint}: Alpine Linux is renowned for its minimal footprint.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Size}: Base image size of approximately 5 MB.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Lightweight Solution}: Provides an exceptionally lightweight solution compared to other distributions.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Overhead Reduction}: Particularly advantageous for containerized applications, where reducing overhead is crucial.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Utilities}: Utilizes musl libc and busybox utilities for a compact size and streamlined functionality.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Efficiency}: Ensures that container environments are both fast and resource-efficient.
        \item[\sA] \sE{Why not Windows?}: While Windows is a robust and user-friendly operating system, it is not designed with containers in mind. Windows containers are larger, require more resources, and have more overhead compared to lightweight Linux containers. Additionally, licensing costs and the complexity of managing updates can be a deterrent for using Windows in a container environment.
