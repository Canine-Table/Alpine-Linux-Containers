            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/interfaces}: The main configuration file for network interfaces. It defines how each network interface is set up (e.g., static IP, DHCP).
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/interfaces.d}: A directory for additional network interface configurations. Any file in this directory will be included by the main interfaces file. This is useful for organizing configurations separately. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-down.d}: Scripts in this directory are executed when an interface is brought down. This can be used for cleaning up or logging. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-post-down.d}: Similar to if-down.d, but these scripts run after the interface has been fully brought down. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-post-up.d}: Scripts here are run after an interface is brought up. Useful for post-configuration tasks like setting additional routes or updating DNS.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-pre-down.d}: Scripts executed before an interface is brought down. Can be used for pre-shutdown checks or preparations.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-pre-up.d}: Scripts that run before an interface is brought up. Useful for preliminary checks or setting up necessary conditions before the interface is up.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-up.d}: Scripts executed when an interface is brought up. These can perform tasks such as updating network settings or notifying other services.

    \sTE{Alpine Linux VM}: Use this setup if you are working with a full virtual machine (VM) environment. This is ideal for scenarios requiring a complete OS with persistent storage, system-level configurations, and traditional init systems like OpenRC.

# Restart the networking service to apply the configurations

    \sTE{Docker Container}: Use this setup if you are running lightweight, isolated applications in containers. This approach is perfect for microservices, testing, and deployment scenarios where quick startup times and efficient resource usage are critical.

# Inside the container: Install necessary packages
apk update && apk upgrade
apk add openrc iproute2

# Create the /run/openrc directory if it doesn't exist and create the softlevel file to bypass OpenRC warnings
# This is required because Docker containers do not typically have an init system like OpenRC by default.
# Without this, you may encounter warnings when trying to manage services with OpenRC.
mkdir -p /run/openrc && touch /run/openrc/softlevel

# Inside the container: Enable and start the networking service
rc-update add networking default
rc-service networking start

# Inside the container: Verify the networking service status
rc-service networking status

        By following these examples, you should have a solid foundation for managing network interfaces in Alpine Linux.
        This structured approach helps keep your network setup organized and efficient.
