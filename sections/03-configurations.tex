            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/interfaces}: The main configuration file for network interfaces. It defines how each network interface is set up (e.g., static IP, DHCP).
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/interfaces.d}: A directory for additional network interface configurations. Any file in this directory will be included by the main interfaces file. This is useful for organizing configurations separately. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-down.d}: Scripts in this directory are executed when an interface is brought down. This can be used for cleaning up or logging. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-post-down.d}: Similar to if-down.d, but these scripts run after the interface has been fully brought down. 
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-post-up.d}: Scripts here are run after an interface is brought up. Useful for post-configuration tasks like setting additional routes or updating DNS.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-pre-down.d}: Scripts executed before an interface is brought down. Can be used for pre-shutdown checks or preparations.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-pre-up.d}: Scripts that run before an interface is brought up. Useful for preliminary checks or setting up necessary conditions before the interface is up.
            \item[\sA] \sE{/etc/network/if-up.d}: Scripts executed when an interface is brought up. These can perform tasks such as updating network settings or notifying other services.

            \item[\sA] \sE{eth0}: Will be assigned a static IP address.
            \item[\sA] \sE{eth1}: Will be configured to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
