    \sTE{Description}: Stack canaries are a security mechanism used to detect and prevent stack buffer overflow attacks, which occur when a program writes more data to a buffer on the stack than it can hold.
    \bigskip
    \begin{baseBoxThree}{Breakdown}{dark}
        \smallskip
        \begin{posnexItemize}
            \item[\sA] \sE{Canary Value}: A small, known value (the "canary") is placed between the stack's control data (such as the return address) and the local variables.
            \item[\sA] \sE{Checking the Canary}: Before a function returns, the canary value is checked to see if it has been altered.
            \item[\sA] \sE{Detection of Overflow}: If a buffer overflow occurs and overwrites the canary value, the program detects the change and typically responds by terminating or taking other protective actions.
        \end{posnexItemize}
        \smallskip
        \begin{baseBoxThree}{}{dark}
            The goal of stack canaries is to prevent the attacker from overwriting important control data, such as return addresses, without being detected.

        \smallskip
        \begin{posnexItemize}
            \item[\sA] \fD{Terminator Canaries}: These canaries contain null bytes, carriage returns, and newline characters, making them difficult to overwrite with standard string functions.
            \item[\sA] \sE{Random Canaries}: These canaries are randomly generated at program startup, making them unpredictable and harder for an attacker to guess.
            \item[\sA] \sE{Guard Pages}: These canaries use memory pages marked as non-readable or non-writable to detect stack overflows.
        \end{posnexItemize}

        \begin{baseBoxThree}{}{dark}
            Stack canaries are an important part of modern software security practices, helping to protect against certain types of buffer overflow attacks.

    \begin{baseBoxThree}{}{dark}
        The script below demonstrates how to create and run two C programsâ€”one with stack canaries enabled and one without.
        The programs are designed to illustrate how stack canaries can detect and prevent buffer overflow attacks.

        \smallskip
            Since this is Alpine, you should expect the program without stack canaries to result in a core dump when a buffer overflow occurs.
            This demonstrates the robustness of Alpine's handling of such vulnerabilities.

    \begin{baseBoxThree}{Wrap Up}{dark}
        \smallskip
        We provided examples of simple C programs, one with stack canaries enabled and one without, to demonstrate how canaries help detect and prevent buffer overflow attacks.
        \\
        
        Stack canaries play a crucial role in modern software security by providing a line of defense against stack buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to serious security breaches, unauthorized access, and system crashes.
        \\

        Stack canaries are just one of many techniques used to enhance software security, but their effectiveness in detecting and preventing buffer overflows makes them a valuable tool in the fight against exploitation.
